**Creating a modular plan**

The user wants me to design a modular plan for building the app "Untitled Folder." The plan should break down the steps and components necessary for testing, with each one defined narrowly to prevent context overflow. They also need an agent config file with clear directives for following the testing path. The goal is to make sure every component can be tested independently for internal verification, ensuring a smooth and effective result through structured, well-defined steps.

**Planning for "Untitled Folder" app**

I'm continuing to plan the app "Untitled Folder." The user hasn't asked about web or file search, so I'll focus on creating a modular plan instead. It'll include key modules such as FileScanner, API integration, and UI components. I'll define each module's scope, responsibilities, inputs, outputs, and test cases. Then, I'll provide an agent config file in JSON format with clear directives on tasks, environment, and tools. I'll break the plan into 7 phases, with each phase tied to specific modules for development and testing.


Thought for 8 seconds


Below is a fully modular, phase-by-phase breakdown of everything needed to build, test and ship **Untitled Folder**, followed by an agent configuration file your orchestrator can consume. Each component is scoped to a single responsibility, with its own test harness and clear inputs/outputs—so you never overload context, and you can verify every piece in isolation.

## Modular Scoped Plan

### Phase 1: Core File Processing

#### 1.1 FileScanner

* **Scope**: Discover all files/folders in a target directory (and subdirectories).
* **Responsibilities**:

  * Walk directory tree
  * Identify "untitled" or generic names (e.g. "Untitled Folder", "New Screenshot 1")
  * Emit a list of paths for renaming
* **Inputs**: `root_path: String`
* **Outputs**: `List<FileMetadata>` (path, mtime, size)
* **Tests**:

  * Unit: simulate in-memory FS with mixed named/unnamed files → expect only the unlabeled ones.
  * Edge: symlinks, permission errors, very deep hierarchies.

#### 1.2 FilenameAnalyzer

* **Scope**: Propose semantic names + clear datetime stamps for each unlabeled item.
* **Responsibilities**:

  * Parse file metadata (mtime, EXIF for images, PDF metadata…)
  * Generate candidate label templates (e.g. `"Screenshot_2025-05-03_14-22"`, `"ProjectProposal_2024-12-10"`)
* **Inputs**: `FileMetadata`
* **Outputs**: `RenameProposal { original_path, new_name }`
* **Tests**:

  * Unit: feed known metadata → expect exact proposals.
  * Error: missing metadata → fallback to creation date.

---

### Phase 2: Renaming & Safety

#### 2.1 RenameExecutor

* **Scope**: Atomically apply a rename (or batch of renames) on disk.
* **Responsibilities**:

  * Validate no name collisions
  * Perform transactional rename (with rollback on failure)
* **Inputs**: `List<RenameProposal>`
* **Outputs**: success/failure report per item
* **Tests**:

  * Unit: dummy FS stub → verify rename or rollback occurs.
  * Edge: collision detection, network drives.

#### 2.2 Dry-Run Mode

* **Scope**: Preview Only (no disk writes).
* **Responsibilities**: same as RenameExecutor, but log actions instead of renaming.
* **Tests**: compare dry-run log against actual rename results.

---

### Phase 3: LLM / Model Integration

#### 3.1 LLMIntegration

* **Scope**: Call external LLM API to refine or localize labels (e.g. language or project-specific naming).
* **Responsibilities**:

  * Package context (max 512 tokens)
  * Send batch requests
  * Parse and merge LLM suggestions with metadata-based defaults
* **Inputs**: `RenameProposal`
* **Outputs**: `EnhancedRenameProposal`
* **Tests**:

  * Unit: stubbed LLM returning known output → verify merge logic.
  * Load: verify context-window enforcement (no token overflow).

#### 3.2 LocalModelFallback

* **Scope**: Offline rename suggestion using embedded model when API unavailable.
* **Responsibilities**: detect offline → route to a small local model.
* **Tests**: simulate API failure → confirm fallback pipeline kicks in.

---

### Phase 4: User Interface

#### 4.1 CLI Component

* **Scope**: Provide command-line interface for power users.
* **Responsibilities**:

  * Flags for root path, dry-run, recursive depth
  * Output rename plan in table format
* **Tests**:

  * Unit: flag parsing
  * Integration: end-to-end CLI run in CI.

#### 4.2 macOS App (SwiftUI)

* **Scope**: Native GUI with drag-and-drop support.
* **Responsibilities**:

  * Display unlabeled items, preview names, checkbox selection
  * Trigger dry-run/execute
* **Tests**:

  * Unit: ViewModel logic
  * UI-test: simulate user flows via XCUITest.

---

### Phase 5: Subscription & Billing

#### 5.1 SubscriptionManager

* **Scope**: Handle in-app purchase (\$1 / month or \$5 / year) via StoreKit.
* **Responsibilities**:

  * Query product info
  * Validate receipts
  * Unlock premium features
* **Tests**:

  * Unit: receipt validation mock
  * Edge: expired/subscribed flows.

#### 5.2 Server-Side Billing API

* **Scope**: Simple backend to record subscriptions and Webhooks.
* **Responsibilities**:

  * Receive App Store server notifications
  * Sync active subscriptions
* **Tests**:

  * Integration: post sample webhook → correct state change.

---

### Phase 6: Distribution & Marketing

#### 6.1 Apple App Store Packaging

* **Scope**: CI job to build `.app`, notarize, upload to App Store Connect.
* **Tests**:

  * CI pipeline simulation
  * Verify correct entitlements, sandbox settings.

#### 6.2 Website & Landing Page

* **Scope**: Static site with marketing copy, signup, billing portal link.
* **Responsibilities**:

  * Showcase features
  * Link to App Store & privacy policy
* **Tests**:

  * Linter/HTML validator
  * Link checks.

---

### Phase 7: Logging, Analytics & CI/CD

#### 7.1 LoggingAnalytics

* **Scope**: Collect anonymized usage data (opt-in).
* **Tests**:

  * Data schema validation
  * GDPR compliance audit.

#### 7.2 CI/CD Pipeline

* **Scope**: Orchestrate unit, integration, UI, packaging and release.
* **Tests**:

  * End-to-end on pull request → gates on test green.

      2. Run its unit tests 
      3. If tests pass, proceed; if tests fail, halt and report"
  - "Enforce max LLM context of 512 tokens in LLMIntegration"
  - "In dry-run, never write to disk"
  - "Record all actions in 'logs/test_report.log'"

You can feed this plan + config straight into your agent orchestrator. Each module has its own tiny context and test harness, so you'll catch bugs early without overflowing any single step.
