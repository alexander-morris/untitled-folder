# Phase 1: Core File Processing

This phase implements the core functionality for scanning and analyzing files in the system.

## Modules

### 1.1 FileScanner

**Purpose**: Discovers all files and folders in a target directory and its subdirectories, identifying untitled or generic names.

**Implementation Details**:
- Swift-based implementation
- Recursive directory traversal
- Pattern matching for untitled files
- File metadata collection

**Dependencies**:
- Foundation framework
- FileManager

### 1.2 FilenameAnalyzer

**Purpose**: Analyzes file metadata to propose semantic names and clear datetime stamps.

**Implementation Details**:
- Metadata extraction (creation date, modification date, EXIF data)
- Name generation based on patterns
- Support for various file types

**Dependencies**:
- Foundation framework
- ImageIO (for EXIF data)
- PDFKit (for PDF metadata)

## Implementation Plan

1. Set up Swift package structure
2. Implement FileScanner with basic directory traversal
3. Add pattern matching for untitled files
4. Implement metadata collection
5. Create FilenameAnalyzer with basic name generation
6. Add support for different file types
7. Implement unit tests for both modules

## Testing Strategy

- Unit tests for each component
- Integration tests for the complete pipeline
- Edge case testing (permissions, symlinks, etc.)
- Performance testing for large directories

## Next Steps

1. Create Swift package structure
2. Implement basic FileScanner functionality
3. Add unit tests
4. Implement FilenameAnalyzer
5. Test integration between components
