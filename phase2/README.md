# Phase 2: Renaming & Safety

This phase implements the functionality for safely renaming files and providing a dry-run mode.

## Modules

### 2.1 RenameExecutor

**Purpose**: Safely executes file and folder renames with collision detection and rollback capabilities.

**Implementation Details**:
- Atomic rename operations
- Collision detection
- Transactional rollback
- Progress reporting

### 2.2 Dry-Run Mode

**Purpose**: Provides a preview of rename operations without making actual changes.

**Implementation Details**:
- Simulated rename operations
- Detailed logging
- Conflict reporting

## Implementation Plan

1. Set up Swift package structure
2. Implement RenameExecutor with basic rename functionality
3. Add collision detection
4. Implement rollback mechanism
5. Create Dry-Run mode
6. Add comprehensive logging
7. Implement unit tests

## Testing Strategy

- Unit tests for each component
- Integration tests for rename operations
- Edge case testing (permissions, network drives)
- Dry-run validation tests

## Next Steps

1. Create Swift package structure
2. Implement basic RenameExecutor
3. Add unit tests
4. Implement Dry-Run mode
5. Test integration with Phase 1 components
